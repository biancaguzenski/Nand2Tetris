### ABOUT/SOBRE

In this project-centered course* you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up. We’ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.

O curso tem o objetivo de construir um computador completo, desde as portas lógicas até o sistema operacional, através de projetos que o aluno deve construir. A primeira parte é focada no hardware do computador Hack, e na segunda parte é implementado um sistema operacional para esse computador.
